    <h1>1: Introduction:</h1>
    <p>Smart homes incorporate automation systems to provide residents with increased convenience, security, energy efficiency and solutions to climate control. Networked 
      devices connect directly/indirectly via a gateway to the internet in order to control/regulate household functions. In 2021, the smart home penetration rate worldwide
       was at 12.2%, the number of smart homes worldwide was >258 million and the forecast smart home market worldwide was at 99.41 bn USD [1].

         <td>Global Warming/Consequences
          CO2 emissions worldwide increased from 6 billion to over 34 billion tonnes between 1950 & 2020 [3]. 
          NASA statistics reveal that from 1800-2021 global surface temperatures increased significantly (-0.1 to 0.8°C). 2021 had the 6th highest temperature on record (NOAA, 2021) due to global warming [4]. 
          In British Columbia, in 2021, 595 deaths occurred related to temperatures > 40 °C (‘heat-dome’), 70% of the dead were aged >70  years and 99% overheated inside a home/hotel [5]. 
          In Ireland 1983-2013, 294 deaths were caused by seven heatwaves [6]. 
          The elderly/disabled are at increased risk during heatwaves [7]. Hyperthermia, is a thermoregulatory disorder where core temperature increases > 40.5°C is a medical emergency. Early recognition of heat increases (externally/internally) is required to reduce the thermal risk [8].

      <h1>Social Implications: </h1>
      <p>Social Implications of the embedded home automation system will include increased independence for users, reduction of their risk of hyperthermia indoors during 
        heatwaves providing reassurance and reductions in energy costs/consumption. It will contribute to The National Housing Strategy for
         Disabled People’s 2022-2027 [13] aim to increase the provision of accessible homes/information/technology to promote people’s participation
         in their communities and assist in the practical implementation of legislated guidelines from The United Nations Convention on the Rights 
         of Persons with Disabilities (2015)/The National Positive Ageing Strategy (2015) [14,15]. Dependency on the internet,
          privacy interference and the expense of implementation/maintenance creating disparities in uptake are some ethical concerns. The website will make the products accessible.

          <h4>Statistics page:</h4> Each graph has daily, weekly, and monthly buttons to show the corresponding statistics. To display the graphs within the webpage, create a CSV file. That CSV file will be then converted to HTML format using Python Script. However, to display the temperature live data, the ThingSpeak platform will be used. 
          In order to show the live data, we used the ThingSpeak platform instead of the CSV file. 
          MicroBit Controller page: On/Off buttons will be included on this page to control the lights or any output device. The live temperature sensor will be displayed using the ThingSpeak platform, a platform for IoT analytics. The value of the Firebase database will be changed when the On/Off button is clicked.

      <h3>2. Explain how well the needs of the envisaged end user are met</h3>
      <p>The product meets the needs of an end user of a person with physical disabilities as it is automatically operated without the need for manual operations. 
        For persons with intellectual disabilities/older persons with conditions such as dementia that effect cognitive abilities the system functions without 
        the need to read temperatures/understand thermostat regulation but reducing their risk of hyperthermia in heatwaves. As it operates when necessary only, 
        it is energy efficient reducing costs for users. </p>

        <h3>3.	Describes with justification how well your artefact could be modified and improved</h3>
        <p>These systems can be further enhanced and linked to Alexa and other IoT based devices. The temperature sensor can also be used  with aother alerting devices such as Alram/ Buzzar to alert . There is a need to develop a mobile application to control the functionalities.
          <br> <br>
          (Revenue in the Smart Home market in the World 2025 | Statista, 2022)
          As it currently is the system is connected to the Fan, the code can be changed to detect to maintain constant room temperatures to users preference. Alerting systems can be generated to inform users that the temperature had been exceeded beyond a set level which can be altered.  
          <br> <br>
          The website can be converted into a mobile app with further control/regulatory functions. 
          Wireless enabled wearable technology (eg Fit bit) that detect physical temperatures could be programmed to activate external environmental climate control devices. These would be beneficial for persons with high temperature to respond to that 
          The 
          <br> <br>
          wireless-enabled wearable technology, physical fitness monitors and activity trackers such as smartwatches, pedometers and monitors for heart rate, quality of sleep and stairs climbed as well as related software
