      <h3>2. Explain how well the needs of the envisaged end user are met</h3>
      <p>
        The product meets the needs of an end user of a person with physical
        disabilities as it is automatically operated without the need for manual
        operations. For persons with intellectual disabilities/older persons
        with conditions such as dementia that effect cognitive abilities the
        system functions without the need to read temperatures/understand
        thermostat regulation but reducing their risk of hyperthermia in
        heatwaves. As it operates when necessary only, it is energy efficient
        reducing costs for users.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. Describes with justification how well your artefact could be modified
        and improved
      </h3>
      <p>
        These systems can be further enhanced and linked to Alexa and other IoT
        based devices. The temperature sensor can also be used with aother
        alerting devices such as Alram/ Buzzar to alert . There is a need to
        develop a mobile application to control the functionalities. <br />
        <br />
        (Revenue in the Smart Home market in the World 2025 | Statista, 2022) As
        it currently is the system is connected to the Fan, the code can be
        changed to detect to maintain constant room temperatures to users
        preference. Alerting systems can be generated to inform users that the
        temperature had been exceeded beyond a set level which can be altered.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website can be converted into a mobile app with further
        control/regulatory functions. Wireless enabled wearable technology (eg
        Fit bit) that detect physical temperatures could be programmed to
        activate external environmental climate control devices. These would be
        beneficial for persons with high temperature to respond to that The
        <br />

        wireless-enabled wearable technology, physical fitness monitors and
        activity trackers such as smartwatches, pedometers and monitors for
        heart rate, quality of sleep and stairs climbed as well as related
        software
