      <h1>Implementation and Testing: </h1>
      <h3>Project Timeline: </h3>
      <p>A project start date and the end date were defined and the below project life cycle was used to manage the program from start to finish. . </p>
        <img src="img/timeLine.png">
      <h3>Investigation Stage:</h3>
      <p>In the investigation phase, I aim to capture the details of each user requirement and to understand the scope of the project and how it will be achieved.</p>

      <h3>Plan stage</h3>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/plan.png">
      <h3>Design Stage</h3>
      <p>During this stage, my goal will be to translate the actual requirements into technical architect design. At this point, I will define the components, programming language, tools, and APIs.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/designStage.png">
      <h3>Create Stage:</h3>
      <p>During this stage, I would be focused on writing the actual program as well as developing the website and database.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/createStage.png">
   
      <h3>Evaluation Stage:</h3>
      <p>During the evaluation phase, I identified the following high-level task. I will test various programs and components to ensure that they work.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/evaluate.png">
      <h3>Document Stage: </h3>
      <p>In the documentation stage, the following tasks will be completed. The main focus is to complete the documntaion and to create a website for brief.</p>

                We also found the other software on our laoptop was ustalisng the COM 3 port. This was discovered during the debugging, 
                once the software was disabled/ closed the connection was established with the Datbase and Microbit.

          6: Clicked On/Off button on the Web page, the script sends data to the Firebase. <br>
          7: Whenever the value is turned On/Off the web page updates the database. Upon turning the value On/Off, the python script on our microbit reads the data and turns the MicroBit device On/Off as per the value.<br>
          8: In order to communicate with Firebase, Python scripts were written in MicroBit.<br>
          9: Connected the micro bit with USB within COM3 port.<br>
          10: Using a web page, we can control the LED Lights remotely. (any output device ).<br>
          11: The web page updates the firebase database, while the Python script coded within the micro:bit reads the values and controls the device based on the value. (On/Off)<br>
